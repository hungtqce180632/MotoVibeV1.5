## Warranty & After-Sales Service

Q: What does your warranty cover?
A: Our standard warranty covers manufacturing defects for 12 months from the date of purchase. 
   Detailed warranty terms are provided with your purchase documentation.

Q: How do I schedule maintenance service?
A: You can schedule maintenance by calling our service center or using the online booking system
   in your customer account. We recommend following the manufacturer's recommended service intervals
   to maintain your warranty validity and ensure optimal performance.

Q: What's the difference between standard and premium warranty?
A: Our standard warranty covers manufacturing defects for 12 months, while our premium warranty 
   extends this coverage to 24 months (2 years). The premium warranty also includes additional 
   coverage for parts and service, roadside assistance, and priority scheduling for maintenance. 
   The premium warranty costs an additional 10% of the motorcycle's purchase price.

Q: What is not covered by the warranty?
A: Our warranties do not cover normal wear and tear, consumable items (oil, filters, tires, brake pads), 
   damage from accidents, misuse, neglect, or improper maintenance. Modifications using non-approved parts 
   may void your warranty. Cosmetic damage and environmental damage (rust, corrosion) are also not covered 
   unless resulting from a manufacturing defect.

Q: Is the warranty transferable if I sell my motorcycle?
A: The standard 12-month warranty is transferable to a new owner for the remainder of the warranty period. 
   The premium 24-month warranty is partially transferable, with some restrictions. To transfer warranty 
   coverage, the new owner must contact our service department and pay a warranty transfer fee of $50.

Q: What maintenance is required to keep my warranty valid?
A: To maintain warranty validity, you must follow the manufacturer's recommended service schedule. 
   This typically includes regular oil changes, fluid checks, and inspections at specified intervals 
   (usually every 3,000-5,000 miles or 3-6 months). All services must be documented and performed by 
   either our authorized service center or a licensed motorcycle mechanic using approved parts.

## Return & Refund Policy

Q: What is your return policy for motorcycles?
A: New motorcycles cannot be returned once registered and delivered, except in cases of proven manufacturing 
   defects that cannot be repaired. In such cases, we offer replacement or refund on a case-by-case basis. 
   Before delivery and registration, orders may be canceled with potential fees depending on order status.

Q: Can I return accessories or apparel items?
A: Yes, unused accessories and unworn apparel can be returned within 14 days of purchase with original 
   packaging and receipt. Custom-ordered accessories are non-returnable. Refunds will be processed within 
   7-10 business days in the original payment method. A 10% restocking fee may apply for opened items.

Q: What if I receive a damaged item?
A: If you receive a damaged accessory or apparel item, contact us within 48 hours of delivery with photos 
   of the damage. We'll arrange for a replacement or refund. For motorcycles, any delivery damage must be 
   noted immediately upon inspection before accepting delivery. Our delivery team will document any issues.

## Shipping & Delivery

Q: Do you ship internationally?
A: Currently, we only offer shipping and delivery within Vietnam. For international customers, we can assist 
   with export documentation if you arrange your own shipping. Please contact our international sales team 
   for more information about purchase and export requirements.

Q: Is home delivery available for motorcycles?
A: Yes, we offer home delivery for motorcycles within a 100km radius of our showroom for a standard fee. 
   Delivery outside this area is available for an additional charge based on distance. During delivery, 
   our team will conduct a final inspection with you and explain basic operations and features.

Q: How are shipping costs calculated?
A: Shipping costs for accessories and apparel are calculated based on weight, dimensions, and delivery location. 
   Orders over 2,000,000 VND qualify for free shipping. For motorcycles, delivery fees start at 1,500,000 VND 
   for local delivery and increase based on distance. Exact delivery costs will be calculated at checkout.

## Technical Support & Troubleshooting

Q: My motorcycle won't start. What should I do?
A: First, check basic elements: 1) Make sure the kill switch is in the "Run" position, 2) Check if the side 
   stand is up (many motorcycles won't start with the stand down), 3) Verify you have fuel. If these are fine, 
   check if the battery has power (lights/display working). If you still have issues, contact our service 
   department for troubleshooting or to arrange service.

Q: How often should I change the oil in my motorcycle?
A: For most models, we recommend changing the oil every 3,000-5,000 kilometers or every 6 months, whichever 
   comes first. High-performance models may require more frequent changes. Always refer to your specific 
   model's owner manual for manufacturer recommendations. Using the recommended oil grade is essential for 
   optimal performance and warranty validity.

Q: What type of fuel should I use in my motorcycle?
A: Most of our motorcycles require premium unleaded fuel (95 RON or higher). Using lower-octane fuel can 
   cause engine knocking and potential damage. Electric models obviously don't require fuel but need regular 
   charging with the supplied charger. Check your owner's manual for specific fuel requirements for your model.

## Events & Community

Q: Does MotoVibe organize any riding events or meetups?
A: Yes, we regularly organize group rides, technical workshops, and community events for our customers. 
   These events range from beginner-friendly rides to advanced skill training sessions. You can find upcoming 
   events on our website's "Events" section or by following our social media channels. Most events are free 
   for MotoVibe customers.

Q: How can I join the MotoVibe Riders Club?
A: The MotoVibe Riders Club is open to all MotoVibe motorcycle owners. To join, simply register through your 
   customer account on our website or visit our showroom. Membership includes exclusive event invitations, 
   merchandise discounts, priority service scheduling, and quarterly newsletters. Annual membership fees are
