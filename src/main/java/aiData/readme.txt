# MotoVibe AI Data Directory

This directory contains data files used by the MotoVibe AI chatbot system.

## Files:

- MotoVibeListMotor.txt: Contains exported motorcycle inventory data in both human-readable and JSON formats.
  This file is generated by the ExportMotorDataServlet and is used to provide the Gemini AI with up-to-date
  information about available motorcycles in the MotoVibe inventory.

## How the data is used:

When a customer asks a question via the chatbot, the system will:
1. Check if the question is motorcycle-related
2. Load the FAQ and motorcycle inventory data
3. Send this data along with the customer's question to the Gemini API
4. Process the response and display it to the customer

The motorcycle data is exported in both human-readable format (for easier human verification) and 
JSON format (for structured machine reading).

## Updating the data:

To update the AI's knowledge about the current motorcycle inventory:
1. Log in as an admin
2. Go to the Motor List page
3. Click the "Export AI Data" button
4. The system will generate a new data file with the current inventory information
